This adds syntax highlighting, command autocompletion, and function documentation for the HP Prime Programming Language (HP PPL) to VSCode, based on firmware revision (14730).

All the commands included in the HP PRIME Calculator User Manual for Programming have been added with information in Spanish. This is the beginning of an attempt to improve programming for the Powerful HP PRIME Calculator, allowing more comfortable programming than using the Connectivity Kit, as that software is a bit outdated. With this extension, we will be able to program much better.

Inspired by this, I created “HP Prime Language” to add function documentation for approximately 800 functions, including overloads. The documentation for these functions comes from an extract made from the calculator in firmware revision 14730 (2023/04/13), with important adaptations made to optimize it for use with VSCode.

Installation directions:

    1.    Installation is simple, just download this extension.
    2.    Now, to program, simply create files, for example: Test1.hpprgrm
    3.    Note: The functions will activate once your file has the .hpprgrm extension.

Important:

    1.    As you can see, it is easy to create a file in VSCode, name it, and add the .hpprgrm extension to it to start programming as you wish. Once programming is complete, you can export your file to the HP PRIME Connectivity Kit, where you can view your well-organized code. However, the reverse is not yet possible — we cannot open .hpprgm files created in the Connectivity Kit. One workaround is to open your code in the Connectivity Kit, copy it directly into VSCode, and then edit it in the best way.
    2.    We still cannot debug our code directly in VSCode, but work is being done to enable debugging in the future. For now, VSCode can be used as a text editor for comfortable code writing.
