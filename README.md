# P+ for HP Prime

<br />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Insoft-UK/PrimePlus/main/assets/P+_Logo.svg" style="width: 128px" />
P+ is a proprietary programming language designed to mitigate the challenges associated with code maintenance and comprehensibility in the HP Programming Language (PPL). P+ serves as an intermediary language that addresses these issues by introducing support for substitutions and facilitating code organization. The final output is a PPL program file with a minimal footprint, optimized to conserve the limited storage space available on the HP Prime.
<br/><br/>
P+ is essentially the PPL language with additional features, such as substitution capabilities, and requires all keywords to be in lowercase.

Please view the test <a href="https://github.com/Insoft-UK/PrimePlus/blob/main/examples/test.pp">code</a> to see what additional features P+ adds to the Prime Programming Language (PPL).

<b>GROB to be intergrated in the next UPDATE!</b>

>[!IMPORTANT]
In P+ `=` is treated as `:=` were in PPL `=` is treated as `==`

>[!NOTE]
The P+ proprietary programming language is susceptible to change, while also maintaining some compatibility with previous versions.
